- Monthly line charts include markers for highest and lowest months for quick visual scanning.  
- Weekly charts are split into two panes (Sales / Profit) with dashed lines to show average and colors to indicate above/below average performance.  
- Product subcategory view uses horizontal bars for easy comparison and an adjacent profit bar to show margin impact.  
- Top 10 customers panel includes rank, order count, sales, profit, and last order date to help identify high-value and dormant accounts.
